# Overview 
I created a library app using tailwindcss, html, and vanilla js.

# Potential Improvement
- Add text overflow capability for title and author
- Add formatting for scenario when title exceeds two lines and it offsets positioning of cards 
- Add a secondary overlay for when a user chooses to delete a book to ask if they are sure they want to delete
- Add backend storage capabilities

# Lessons Learned
- leverage objects and their prototypes
- modify the DOM when new elements/cards are created
- add an overlay with a form
- pass form data to javascript variables
- leverage additional formatting capabilities with tailwindcss
